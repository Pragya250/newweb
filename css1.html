<h2><b><center>Why do we celebrate halloween</center></b></h2>

<p><i>Halloween's origins can be traced back to the ancient Celtic festival known as Samhain,which was held on November 1 in contemporary calenders.It was believed that on that day,the souls of the dead returned to their homes,so people dressed in costumed and lit bonfires to ward off spirits.Borrowing from European traditions, Americans began to dress up in costumes and go house to house asking for food or money, a practice that eventually became today’s “trick-or-treat” tradition. Young women believed that on Halloween they could divine the name or appearance of their future husband by doing tricks with yarn, apple parings or mirrors.</i></p><hr>
